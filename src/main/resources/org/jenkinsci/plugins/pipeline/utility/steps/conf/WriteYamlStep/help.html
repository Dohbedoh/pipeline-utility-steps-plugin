<p>
    Writes a yaml file in the current working directory from an Object or a String.
    It uses <a href="https://bitbucket.org/asomov/snakeyaml" target="_blank">SnakeYAML</a> as YAML processor.
    The call will fail if the file already exists.
</p>
<strong>Fields:</strong>
<ul>
    <li>
        <code>file</code>:
        Mandatory path to a file in the workspace to write the YAML datas to.
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>data</code>:
        A Mandatory Object containing the data to be serialized.
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>charset</code> <i>(optional)</i>:
        Optionally specify the charset to use when writing the file. Defaults to <code>UTF-8</code> if nothing else is specified.
        What charsets that are available depends on your Jenkins master system.
        The java specification tells us though that at least the following should be available:
        <ul>
            <li>US-ASCII</li>
            <li>ISO-8859-1</li>
            <li>UTF-8</li>
            <li>UTF-16BE</li>
            <li>UTF-16LE</li>
            <li>UTF-16</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>overwrite</code> <i>(optional)</i>:
        Allow existing files to be overwritten. Defaults to <code>true</code>.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Examples:</strong><br/>
    <code>
        <pre>
        def amap = ['something': 'my datas',
                    'size': 3,
                    'isEmpty': false]

        writeYaml file: 'datas.yaml', data: amap
        def read = readYaml file: 'datas.yaml'

        assert read.something == 'my datas'
        assert read.size == 3
        assert read.isEmpty == false
        </pre>
    </code>
</p>
